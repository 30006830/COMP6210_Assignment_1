  <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p1>This assignment is based on the SCP Foundation, meaning Secure. Contain. Protect. The aim is to design, create, build and test a small web application using both client and server side technologies and a web server scriptinng language.<br><br>
      The scenario reads:<br> You work for the SCP Foundation, a secret organisation responsible for locating and containing individuals, entities, locations and objects that violate natural law.<br><br>
      The web based catalogue system used by the foundation (developed in the 90s) is becoming
      unwieldy to maintain and update, and is visually unsuited for mobile devices used by SCP agents in
      the field.<br><br>
      You are tasked with creating a web based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with an
      interface that conforms to modern web standards and is mobile responsive.<br><br>
      For this assignment you only need to develop the Create and Read functions.<br><br>
      The project has been divided into 3 tasks (Part A, B, C) for you to work on and complete.<br><br>
      The SCP Subject files we were given are:
    </p1>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item">SCP-002</li>
        <li class="list-item">SCP-003</li>
        <li class="list-item">SCP-004</li>
        <li class="list-item">SCP-005</li>
        <li class="list-item">SCP-006</li>
      </ul>
    <p1>The files for these Subjects are displayed on the SCP Files webpage, this can be located at the top of the navbar next to the SCP Logo.<br><br></p1>
